you&#39;re a paradox you&#39;re ambitious but lazy something in you has to wake up you want to be successful but you constantly hold yourself back and usually the only person that can wake it up is you you tell people how you&#39;re going to achieve all these great things but as soon as they doubt you you become discouraged you&#39;re a walking contradiction and so was I didn&#39;t you say you were going to lock in the summer what happened don&#39;t forget the passage of time stops for no one see recently I heard a quote that was so powerful it said how there are 1,440 minutes in a day and you can&#39;t spend 60 of them working on your dreams and for me that quote hits so hard because how many people do you always hear say I just don&#39;t have the time to do it or I&#39;m too tired to start the last thing you want to do is Fast Forward 5 years 10 years and think to yourself I probably should have spent those years doing something a little bit different whoops and see I know these excuses because I used to constantly make them I&#39;d say I can leave that work until tomorrow I tell the people close to me about how this was going to be the year I was successful and I tell them how I was going to start waking up early and get in a really good routine but when the time came to actually do it I wouldn&#39;t back up all this big talk and because of that I felt like I looked like a joke to the people close to me and inside I kind of felt like a joke because how are you ever meant to have self-respect and how is anyone else meant to take you seriously if you can&#39;t even stick to your own word and I&#39;ve realized I was constantly anxious because I had a to-do list I wasn&#39;t doing and really that&#39;s where most anxiety comes from you have decisions you know you need to make like the decision to start into your work but you aren&#39;t making them but see things finally changed for me when I decided I&#39;d had enough I realized I was the only person holding me back and if I ever wanted to be successful and get out of this lazy ambitious did it I had to change my mentality and figure out why I really wanted to be successful because without a strong way and clear goals you will never end up taking action as James Clear says when your dreams are fague it&#39;s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed like even recently I&#39;ve been thinking that to be successful you really just have to go to war against yourself you have to go to war against your Comforts your fears your insecurities your self-doubt your procrastination and your lack of discipline and see discipline was the first thing I knew I had to develop I knew no matter what my feelings were I just had to confront the hard tasks in front of me I had to learn to get comfortable being uncomfortable because I knew that was the only way I was ever going to see growth and I was at a stage where I was so fed up with my situation that I literally went out of my way to find hard tasks to confront because I really just wanted to train my mind to stop fearing hard things and honestly the best quote I&#39;ve heard on discipline is from this ice bath guy he says everybody says how discipline is so important but they never want to tell you why it&#39;s the strongest form of selflove it&#39;s ignoring something you want right now for something better later on discipline reveals the commitment you have to your dreams especially on the days where you don&#39;t want to the Future you is depending on the current you to keep the promises you made to yourself yesterday and listen I&#39;m no goggin I&#39;m still trying to improve my discipline daily brother because I even know I can get a lot more disciplined but over this last year one of the best ways I have strengthened my discipline muscle is honestly just showing up consistently each day and doing the tasks I&#39;ve set for myself and this goes for smaller tasks like making your bed cleaning your dishes planning tomorrow today and packing your gym bag the night before that sort of stuff because I used to hear guys like Jordan Peterson and Joo willink say stuff like to be successful you have got to make your bed in the morning and I&#39;d be like right stop bsing me because I clicked on this video for you to give me some actual advice but now after all this time I actually understand what they were saying because over this last year I&#39;ve been living with that mentality of how how you do one thing is how you do everything and when you think about it it makes complete sense because if you don&#39;t have the discipline to do these smaller tasks how are you ever going to find the strength to confront the bigger ones and if working hard and being disciplined is something that you haven&#39;t been good at in the past good because you want to know something interesting you&#39;re going to discover a whole new part of yourself that you haven&#39;t seen before because recently I heard Jordan Peterson say that if you put yourself in a new situation then the situation stress that is produced from that situation unlocks new genes in your body and builds new parts of you so isn&#39;t that really cool to just think that we can transform ourselves so much by just consistently putting ourselves in new uncomfortable situations and that&#39;s why I highly recommend that daily you do some things that take you out of your comfort zone and make you feel uncomfortable because that&#39;s the fastest way you can grow as a person and the situations I personally put myself through daily that make me feel uncomfortable is waking up early and going to the gym running training to failure in my sets doing multiple deep work blocks a day getting in cold water and talking to new people and through daily repetition these things have now become a habit for me to the point I actually feel kind of weird if I don&#39;t do them which is such a transition from where I used to be because I used to be a relatively Shay gay who didn&#39;t want to work that hard hard and honestly to really become a hardworking person you need to change your habits you need to make consistently showing up and doing your best each day a habit you need to set yourself a specific time to wake up and a specific time to start your work you need to plan what actions you are going to take each day and just consistently do them because when you really ask yourself what is it I need to do in order to become successful as confusing as we all make it out to be it really is simple and that&#39;s consistency and hard work and yeah I understand the sayings work smarter not harder and you have to work on the right things I get that but if you can work smarter and harder your mindset starts to change from what if I can achieve it to when am I going to achieve it because when you consistently show up and do the work you said you were going to do brother you get a confidence in yourself where you feel like no matter what goal you were to pursue if you worked hard enough at it you could achieve it and the best way I think to develop a habit is to just consistently do it each day and genuinely one of the best sayings I&#39;ve heard is we are what we repeatedly do therefore Excellence is not an act but a habit and look I&#39;m not trying to be some cringe cliche motivational guy even though that&#39;s what I probably sound like sometimes but to be honest I&#39;m just talking as if I&#39;m giving advice to me from a year ago because at that time this is what I genuinely needed to hear and and over this last while I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s a lot easier to attack your real goals when you have the right environment around you what do I mean by this well we have all heard the famous line we are the sum total of the five people we spent the most time with and it&#39;s true because if you are hanging around people who are constantly negative you are going to feel negative if all five of your friends are gym rats you are going to be one also just like they say if you hang around five millionaires you are going to become the sixth and that&#39;s why if you have the right people around you it&#39;s a lot easier to work hard and become successful because literally 90% of your thinking comes from those around you so ask yourself are the people you are spending most of your time with actually good for you and this goes for what you are consuming online also because if you are constantly consuming negative BS and random drama and beef online or just watching mind numing content in general it&#39;s going to rub off on you because even though you may not really realize it what you consume programs your way of thinking like even I find the more I watch someone&#39;s content the more I start to think like them and that&#39;s why you need to be conscious of what you are actually consuming and that&#39;s why I personally like to consume content that makes me feel inspired and teaches me new ideas and new things because if you constantly listen to the right things you can literally start to reprogram your mind for Success instead of consuming stuff that just causes you to have worse thoughts and feel more negative and there&#39;s this old guy Brian Tracy who I think is an entrepreneur who talked about this topic in a way that made complete sense he said if you associate with people who don&#39;t work hard who don&#39;t learn who socialize after work then you become like them you think like them you marry them and then you are married to someone who also has no ambition and then he goes on to say but top people associate with other top people and yeah I get you may be thinking I understand all of that but where can I actually find positive successful people well he says first you become one and then you naturally attract them and from firsthand experience I got to say that&#39;s so true because if you become a positive person and hold a positive mentality you naturally attract those who are positive and you begin to repel negative people because you&#39;re in a state where you are just no longer tolerating that BS and having the right people around you is genuinely one of the biggest hacks because when you have hardworking people around you it makes you want to work a lot harder and it even allows for some friendly competition which just allows for everyone to improve and you also just no longer have all these people around you who are constantly making you doubt your goals and constantly telling you how you won&#39;t achieve them and honestly that&#39;s one of the reasons I never told many people I was going to try YouTube because I just knew they were going to say I couldn&#39;t do it and why would you try something so stupid so ultimately what was the point of me telling them and lastly you need to change your way of thinking because you become what you think about and I fully get if you don&#39;t believe the whole manifesting thing but just think of this in an actual physical sense your thoughts become your feelings and then your feelings become your actions so if you are constantly thinking you can&#39;t do something you are going to get that feeling of doubt and failure and then your actions are going to show that by you procrastinating your tasks and not doing them to the best of your abilities because you think what&#39;s the point if I&#39;m going to fail anyway just like oppositely if you are thinking about success and thinking you can do it you are going to have a feeling of confidence and you&#39;re going to end up taking action and giving it your best effort because why wouldn&#39;t you if you think you&#39;re going to succeed and look brother a year flies by like I really feel like it was no time ago I had 400 subs and was just lost in life and obviously all thanks to God for the success he has brought me so far but ask yourself do you want to look back in another year thinking about how much time you wasted or do you want to be able to look back and be so thankful that you put in the work because as they say you can either feel the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and look you aren&#39;t going to see results right away so during them tough times you just got to keep your confidence high and you got to learn to fall in love with the process because it makes every day just feel like a win and I&#39;ll end the video with this Bible quote lazy people want much but get little but those who work hard will prosper so brother let&#39;s put in the work now so we can look back and be so grateful about how we spent our time and forget about the past where you may have wasted time or what you did yesterday it doesn&#39;t matter because today is a clean slate for you to start and today is the youngest you will ever be for the rest of your life anyway I&#39;d really appreciate if you could subscribe and leave an insightful comment down below and let me know your Ambitions for the next 12 months because I&#39;d love if we could turn the comment section into a a
